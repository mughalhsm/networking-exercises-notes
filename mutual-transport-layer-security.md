# What is mTLS?

Mutual TLS (mTLS), short for Mutual Transport Layer Security, is a method for mutual authentication and encryption of network communication. It ensures that both parties at each end of a network connection, typically a client and a server, are who they claim to be by verifying that they both possess the correct private key and corresponding TLS certificates. These certificates contain essential information for verifying the identity of the parties involved.

## How is it different from TLS?

The key differences between mTLS and TLS are as follows:

1. **Authentication Process:**
   - **TLS**: In traditional TLS (Transport Layer Security), only the server has a TLS certificate and a public/private key pair, while the client typically does not have a certificate. The client verifies the server's certificate to ensure the server's identity.
   - **mTLS**: In mutual TLS, both the client and the server have TLS certificates and public/private key pairs. Both the client and the server authenticate each other by presenting their respective certificates. This dual authentication process adds an extra layer of security.

2. **Use of Certificates:**
   - **TLS**: TLS certificates are primarily used to verify the server's identity. The client checks the server's certificate to confirm that it is connecting to the correct server.
   - **mTLS**: In mTLS, certificates are used for mutual authentication. The client and the server both use their certificates to prove their identities to each other.

3. **Certificate Authorities:**
   - **TLS**: In traditional TLS, a certificate authority (CA) issues the server's certificate and validates the ownership of the associated domain.
   - **mTLS**: Organisations implementing mTLS often act as their own certificate authorities. They create a self-signed "root" TLS certificate, which enables them to issue certificates for authorized clients and servers within their organisation. This is in contrast to the external CAs used in standard TLS.

4. **Security Benefits:**
   - **TLS**: TLS primarily focuses on securing communication between the client and the server by ensuring the server's authenticity and encrypting data in transit.
   - **mTLS**: mTLS provides an additional layer of security by authenticating both the client and the server. This makes it particularly useful for scenarios where trust in both directions is critical, such as authenticating users, devices, and servers within an organisation.

5. **Use Cases:**
   - **TLS**: Traditional TLS is commonly used for securing web traffic, ensuring that users connect to legitimate websites and that their data remains confidential during transmission.
   - **mTLS**: mTLS is typically used in situations where trust must be established in both directions, such as within an organisation's internal network, for IoT device communication, or when securing APIs.

In summary, mTLS is an extension of the TLS protocol that provides mutual authentication, enhancing security by verifying the identities of both the client and the server in a network connection. This added layer of trust is valuable for organisations and scenarios where bidirectional authentication and secure communication are paramount.
